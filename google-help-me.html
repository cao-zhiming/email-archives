    <p>Dear Google,</p>

<p>I couldn't login to my google account [THIS EMAIL ADDRESS IS BEING PROTECTED] now. I entered the right password but it asks me for a 2-step verification just because I moved to a new state for living and working. Sadly, it asked me to recieve messages or phone calls to a number that I can't access now. I can now only access to the security backup account of it. But there are some important apps my company and me use which I signed up with Google. I really wish if you can help me login. I would like to take part in any kinds of operations to identify myself.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,
  The owner of [THIS EMAIL ADDRESS IS BEING PROTECTED], Tom Weasel.</p>
