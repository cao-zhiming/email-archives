  <body>
  <p>Dear the Freenom Team,</p>

<p>I apologize that this may give you some difficulties, but here I got some problem and I really appreciate if you can help me.</p>

<p>I signed up to freenom a year ago with my Google Account ([THIS EMAIL ADDRESS IS BEING PROTECTED]), and I registered some domains such as <strong>xiaocao16.tk, caozhiming.tk, caozhiming.ml, caoz.ml, fuider.tk, bugduck.ga</strong> after that.</p>

<p>But recently I wrongly deleted my Google Account. <strong>That means I can not access to my Freenom account either, since I haven't set a login method via email and password.</strong> And things are even worse, I can not register a new Google Account because of technical reasons. But some of my domains are going to expire and I really wish <strong>you can help me by resetting my password manually</strong>.</p>

<p>I claim: I am [THIS EMAIL ADDRESS IS BEING PROTECTED] on freenom.com, and I would like to recieve any kind of punishments accordingly if this made anyone's account unsafe. I would also like to take part in any kinds of procedure to make sure I am really myself. I also stored a PGP Key at <a href="//keybase.io/caozhiming">Keybase</a> to show my identity.</p>

  <p>Thank you very much and I apologize again.</p>

<p>Yours, 
  Tom Weasel.</p>
